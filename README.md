## 📌 Overview

This repository contains my submission for **Home Assignment 4**, which includes:

* Part A: Manual clustering calculations (Hierarchical Clustering + K-Means)
* Part B: Short-answer questions on clustering and NLP concepts
* Part C: Python code for tokenization, lemmatization, POS filtering, Named Entity Recognition (NER), and pronoun ambiguity detection.

---

## 🧮 Part A: Clustering Calculations

### **Q1: Hierarchical Clustering (Single-link & Average-link)**

* Built the **full Euclidean distance matrix** for all points.
* Applied **Single-Link (MIN)** and **Average-Link** hierarchical clustering.
* Recorded **merge steps** and **dendrogram structures**.

### **Q2: K-Means Clustering (K = 3)**

* Calculated distances from each point to initial centroids.
* Assigned points to nearest clusters (tie → assign to smallest index centroid).
* Computed new centroids after each iteration.
* Continued iterations until **cluster membership stabilized** (convergence).

## 🧠 Part B: Short Answer Concepts

Topics explained include:

* Agglomerative vs. Divisive hierarchical clustering
* Inter-cluster vs. intra-cluster distance in cluster quality
* Linkage methods: Single, Complete, Average
* Tokenization role in NLP
* Stemming vs. Lemmatization
* Word sense and pronoun ambiguity
* Why POS tagging cannot predict words independently

| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `q1_nlp.py`                 | Tokenization → Stopword removal → Lemmatization → Keep only nouns & verbs |
| `q2_ner_pronoun_warning.py` | Performs Named Entity Recognition and checks for pronoun ambiguity        |

### Requirements

```bash
pip install spacy
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

### Usage

Run:

```bash
python q1_nlp.py
python q2_ner_pronoun_warning.py
```
